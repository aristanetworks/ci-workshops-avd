## **ATD Dual Datacenter Topology**

In this example, the ATD lab is used to create the L2LS Dual Data Center topology below. The IP Network cloud (orange area) is pre-provisioned and is comprised of the border and core nodes in the ATD topology. Our focus will be creating the L2LS AVD data models to build and deploy configurations for Site 1 and Site 2 (blue areas) and connect them to the IP Network.
